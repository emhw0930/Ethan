            <h3>Background: </h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I currently reside in Berkeley, California, but I was born and raised in Taipei, Taiwan. I love to eat Japanese, 
                Korean, and Taiwanese food, and I enjoy playing badminton, basketball, and table tennis during my spare time. Most
                importantly, I love to code.
                <br><br>
                My first experience with coding was during my high school years when I participated in VEX Robotics. Our goal was 
                to build a robot that could move and perform tasks autonomously without the need for manual control, and this is 
                where coding came into play. After my experience in robotics, I discovered my interest in the field of computer 
                science, where coding can be used to achieve great things!
                <br><br>
                Upon entering college, I enrolled in a class called CS88, Computational Structure in Data Science, and this is 
                where I began my computer science journey. Due to the excellent content, pace, and resources of this course, I 
                confirmed my desire to major in computer science and became eager to be part of the course staff.
                <br><br>
                After taking CS88 during my first semester of sophomore year, I was certain that I wanted to major in computer 
                science. Therefore, I decided to take CS61A, CS61B, and CS70 during the second semester of my sophomore year. 
                During that semester, I also joined the CS88 Course Staff as an academic intern.

            <h3>Computer Scinece + Teaching?</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                As an academic intern in CS88, I learned how to conduct office hours, specifically by providing students with hints on 
                homework, lab, and project questions without hindering their ability to learn. 
                <br><br>
                Initially, as an international student whose native language isn't English, it was challenging for me to explain a question 
                or concept effectively. However, after working as an Academic Intern for a semester, I learned how to improve my 
                explanation skills and also enhanced my English speaking ability. Most importantly, I found great joy in teaching. 
                Witnessing students grow and learn after I teach a concept is incredibly fulfilling for me, which is why I embarked on my 
                journey in computer science teaching.
                <br><br>
                After being an academic intern, one of my life goals is to officially be a part of the course staff, eg tutor or TA. To 
                accomplish this goal, I joined a club call Computer Science Mentor where we learn and grow as a teacher as well as getting 
                know with other CS majors students. After applying and interviewing, I joined CS88 CSM as a junior mentor where I host weekly 
                review sections for 5 students enrolled in CS88.
