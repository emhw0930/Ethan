            <p> 
                CS 88 is for students who would like a more complete introduction to Computer Science. We will cover a variety 
                of topics such as functional programming, data abstraction, object-oriented programming, and program complexity. 
                This course will be taught primarily in Python. However, we are interested in teaching you foundational programming
                ideas, not just how to use one particular programming language.

                <br> As a part of course staff, I participate in weekly staff meeting with 15 other staff members as well as Professor
                Michael Ball. Our goal is to assist student to learn and enjoy the most fundamental part of computer science. 
                As a tutor, I host weekly office hours, hold midterm review sections, and reply questions on ed to assist 500+ students
                in learning.

                CSM is a student-run organization that provides guidance and resources in a smaller classroom environment through group 
                tutoring sessions. Each section has 4-6 students and focuses on material from one of the courses listed above. Outside 
                of teaching, our mentors watch movies, climb up to Soda almost everyday, hike, study together, and more!

                <b>Senior Content Mentor:</b> 
                <br> As a senior content mentor, I learned how to use overleaf to make practice coding problems
                with skeleton code for weekly content worksheets for the mentors in CS88: Computational Structure in Data Science to use
                as a supplement for weekly teaching sections. In addition, I am also a mentor who teach a section to 5 people weekly for 
                CS88 on the content of iteration, recursion, trees, linked list, OOP, and higher order function.

                <br> As a junior mentor, I learned how to teach a section, answer questions, and the techniques of 
                whiteboarding for students to visualize a complicated concept. In addition, I also make walkthrough videos to explain
                past midterms and finals problems and post it on the CS88 official website to enhance students' learning experiences and 
                help them to review for midterm and final.

                <b>Computer Vision Summer Intern:</b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv5ozpfohB4&t=34s" id="link">link</a>
                <br>
                This was my first summer internship, located in Taichung, Taiwan. As a computer vision intern, I learned how to 
                use YOLO V5, OpenCV, and Python to train a customized dataset of Sambar Deer images for object detection. This 
                enabled me to detect the position and activity of the deer in the frame for the local animal farm.
                <br>
                <br>
                The most challenging obstacle I faced during the internship was ensuring that the index for each deer remained 
                consistent throughout the entire video. Since the deer would move around and the index provided by YOLO V5 
                differed in every frame, I calculated the Euclidean distance between each deer in the current frame and every 
                other deer in the previous frame. Then, I assigned the index of the current frame's deer to be the index of the 
                closest deer from the previous frame based on this distance calculation. This approach ensured that the index of 
                the same deer remained constant throughout the entire video.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout this internship, I learned the basic of computer vision, including how to train a dataset, label image,
                use OpenCV, and fine tune the model.
